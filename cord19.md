# Documentation and Reflection
"""
CORD-19 Data Analysis Project - Documentation

Project Overview:
This project analyzes the CORD-19 dataset metadata to understand patterns in COVID-19 research publications.

Key Findings:
1. Temporal Distribution: Most papers were published in 2020-2021, reflecting the peak of COVID-19 research.
2. Journal Distribution: A few major journals published the majority of COVID-19 research.
3. Common Topics: Title analysis reveals focus on terms like "covid", "pandemic", "sars", "health", etc.

Challenges Encountered:
1. Data Quality: Many missing values in abstract and journal columns required careful handling.
2. Date Format: Inconsistent date formats required custom parsing logic.
3. Memory Management: Large file size required efficient memory usage techniques.

Learning Outcomes:
1. Enhanced pandas skills for data cleaning and manipulation.
2. Improved visualization techniques with matplotlib and seaborn.
3. Experience building interactive web applications with Streamlit.
4. Better understanding of handling real-world, messy datasets.

Future Improvements:
1. Add more advanced NLP analysis (sentiment, topic modeling).
2. Implement citation analysis if citation data is available.
3. Add more interactive filters and visualizations.
4. Optimize performance for larger datasets.

Code Organization:
- The project is organized into logical sections for easy maintenance.
- Functions are used for reusable operations.
- Comments are added for clarity.
- Visualizations are saved for documentation.

Dependencies:
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud, streamlit
